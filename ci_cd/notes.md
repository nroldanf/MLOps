# CI/CD (Continous Integration and Continous Delivery/Deployment)

Automating stages of development.

## Continous Integration (CI)

Every following step is done automatically:

__Build__: Set up environment, dependencies, packages tools, etc.
__Test__: Automatic testing on an event.
__Merge__: Merge of branches.

## Continous Delivery/Continous Deployment

Release to repository and deploy to production.

## Why it matters?

Allows to faster and regular cycles, introducing new features and releases and testing it more rapidly. Trying to keep small logs and changes, more easy to handle and track.
